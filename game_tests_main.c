 *   Student: Aidan Schrier
 *   Semester: Spring 2023
 *
 *   This file builds the foundation for a 'testing' framework for the game
 *   You will want to build unit tests in this file, and run them. 
 *   You have freedom to use this file as you need. It also provides
 *   an example of how to control the random seed.
 * 
 *   For reference, we are using a file similar to this for auto-grading.
